| 3 | Open Model         | <ul><li>The model has been developed using Free and open simulation software;</li> <li>All mode code is reusable and adaptable under the permissive MIT license model;</li><li>The model is documented in detail within a online Jupyter Book;</li><li>Additional documentation organised by the [STRESS-DES checklist](../03_stress/01_objectives.md) within the Jupyter Book.</li></ul> |
| 4 | Open Environment   | A [docker image is available via dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tommonks01/treat_sim) to enable replication of the OS and software environment and model execution on a local machine.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5 | Open Infrastucture | The model can be run online using BinderHub or Thebe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
